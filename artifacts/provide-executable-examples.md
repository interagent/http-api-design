#### Provide executable examples

Provide executable examples that users can type directly into their
terminals to see working API calls. To the greatest extent possible,
these examples should be usable verbatim, to minimize the amount of
work a user needs to do to try the API, e.g.:

```bash
$ export TOKEN=... # acquire from dashboard
$ curl -is https://$TOKEN@service.com/users
```

If you use [prmd](https://github.com/interagent/prmd) to generate Markdown
docs, you will get examples for each endpoint for free.
