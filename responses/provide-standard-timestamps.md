#### Provide standard timestamps

Provide `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for resources by default,
e.g:

```javascript
{
  // ...
  "created_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2012-01-01T13:00:00Z",
  // ...
}
```

These timestamps may not make sense for some resources, in which case
they can be omitted.
