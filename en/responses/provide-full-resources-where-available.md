#### Provide full resources where available

Provide the full resource representation (i.e. the object with all
attributes) whenever possible in the response. Always provide the full
resource on 200 and 201 responses, including `PUT`/`PATCH` and `DELETE`
requests, e.g.:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE \
  https://service.com/apps/1f9b/domains/0fd4

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
...
{
  "created_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "hostname": "subdomain.example.com",
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "updated_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

202 responses will not include the full resource representation,
e.g.:

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE \
  https://service.com/apps/1f9b/dynos/05bd

HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
...
{}
```
