#### Generate structured errors

Generate consistent, structured response bodies on errors. Include a
machine-readable error `id`, a human-readable error `message`, and
optionally a `url` pointing the client to further information about the
error and how to resolve it, e.g.:

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
```

```json
{
  "id":      "rate_limit",
  "message": "Account reached its API rate limit.",
  "url":     "https://docs.service.com/rate-limits"
}
```

Document your error format and the possible error `id`s that clients may
encounter.
