#### Provide resource (UU)IDs

Give each resource an `id` attribute by default. Use UUIDs unless you
have a very good reason not to. Don’t use IDs that won’t be globally
unique across instances of the service or other resources in the
service, especially auto-incrementing IDs.

Render UUIDs in downcased `8-4-4-4-12` format, e.g.:

```
"id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
```
