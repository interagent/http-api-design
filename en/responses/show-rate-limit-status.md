#### Show rate limit status

Rate limit requests from clients to protect the health of the service
and maintain high service quality for other clients. You can use a
[token bucket algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) to
quantify request limits.

Return the remaining number of request tokens with each request in the
`RateLimit-Remaining` response header.
