#### Return appropriate status codes

Return appropriate HTTP status codes with each response. Successful
responses should be coded according to this guide:

* `200`: Request succeeded for a `GET` call, for a `DELETE` or
  `PATCH` call that completed synchronously, or for a `PUT` call that
  synchronously updated an existing resource
* `201`: Request succeeded for a `POST` call that completed
  synchronously, or for a `PUT` call that synchronously created a new
  resource
* `202`: Request accepted for a `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, or `PATCH` call that
  will be processed asynchronously
* `206`: Request succeeded on `GET`, but only a partial response
  returned: see [above on ranges](../foundations/divide-large-responses-across-requests-with-ranges.md)

Pay attention to the use of authentication and authorization error codes:

* `401 Unauthorized`: Request failed because user is not authenticated
* `403 Forbidden`: Request failed because user does not have authorization to access a specific resource

Return suitable codes to provide additional information when there are errors:

* `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Your request was understood, but contained invalid parameters
* `429 Too Many Requests`: You have been rate-limited, retry later
* `500 Internal Server Error`: Something went wrong on the server, check status site and/or report the issue

Refer to the [HTTP response code spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6)
for guidance on status codes for user error and server error cases.
