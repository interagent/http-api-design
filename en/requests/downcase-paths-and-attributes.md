#### Downcase paths and attributes

Use downcased and dash-separated path names, for alignment with
hostnames, e.g:

```
service-api.com/users
service-api.com/app-setups
```

Downcase attributes as well, but use underscore separators so that
attribute names can be typed without quotes in JavaScript, e.g.:

```
service_class: "first"
```
