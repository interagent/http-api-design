##### Actions

Prefer endpoint layouts that don’t need any special actions for
individual resources. In cases where special actions are needed, place
them under a standard `actions` prefix, to clearly delineate them:

```
/resources/:resource/actions/:action
```

e.g.

```
/runs/{run_id}/actions/stop
```
