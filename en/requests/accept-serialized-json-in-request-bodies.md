#### Accept serialized JSON in request bodies

Accept serialized JSON on `PUT`/`PATCH`/`POST` request bodies, either
instead of or in addition to form-encoded data. This creates symmetry
with JSON-serialized response bodies, e.g.:

```bash
$ curl -X POST https://service.com/apps \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "demoapp"}'

{
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "name": "demoapp",
  "owner": {
    "email": "username@example.com",
    "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
  },
  ...
}
```
