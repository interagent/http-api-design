#### Minimize path nesting

In data models with nested parent/child resource relationships, paths
may become deeply nested, e.g.:

```
/orgs/{org_id}/apps/{app_id}/dynos/{dyno_id}
```

Limit nesting depth by preferring to locate resources at the root
path. Use nesting to indicate scoped collections. For example, for the
case above where a dyno belongs to an app belongs to an org:

```
/orgs/{org_id}
/orgs/{org_id}/apps
/apps/{app_id}
/apps/{app_id}/dynos
/dynos/{dyno_id}
```
